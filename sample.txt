Rivers are a symbol of life, providing essential resources vital for the health and well-being of our planet.
They provide a habitat for a variety of plants and animals and are necessary for our ecosystems.
Fish swim in their waters, birds fly overhead, and beavers build their dams, all relying on the river for their survival.
Many trees and vegetation rely on seeds carried by rivers to be dispersed for thousands of miles.
